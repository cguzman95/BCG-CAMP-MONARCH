# MultiGPUOpenMPCAMP

Sample of a linear solver used to develop CAMP GPU. Useful for evaluate performance on iterative solvers, such as the linear solver used and the solver of CAMP. The linear solver algorithm is the Biconjugate Gradient (BCG). Details can be found on the CAMP GPU paper by C. Guzman (https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17363).
